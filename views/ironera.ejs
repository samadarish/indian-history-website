         <hr>
         <p>The Vedic culture was located in part of north-west India, while other parts of India had a distinct cultural identity during this period. The Vedic culture is described in the texts of Vedas, still sacred to Hindus, which were orally composed and transmitted in Vedic Sanskrit. The Vedas are some of the oldest extant texts in India.[54] The Vedic period, lasting from about 1500 to 500 BCE,[55][56] contributed the foundations of several cultural aspects of the Indian subcontinent. In terms of culture, many regions of the Indian subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age in this period.

         <h2 class="blog-post-title">History</h2>
         <p class="blog-post-meta">December 23, 2013 by <a href="#">Jacob</a></p>
         <p>
            Historians have analysed the Vedas to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[57] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the Indian subcontinent from the north-west.[59][60] The peepal tree and cow were sanctified by the time of the Atharva Veda.[61] Many of the concepts of Indian philosophy espoused later, like dharma, trace their roots to Vedic antecedents.[62]
            <br><br>
            Early Vedic society is described in the Rigveda, the oldest Vedic text, believed to have been compiled during 2nd millennium BCE,[63][64] in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent.[65] At this time, Aryan society consisted of largely tribal and pastoral groups, distinct from the Harappan urbanization which had been abandoned.[66] The early Indo-Aryan presence probably corresponds, in part, to the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture in archaeological contexts.[67][68]
            <br><br>
            At the end of the Rigvedic period, the Aryan society began to expand from the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent, into the western Ganges plain. It became increasingly agricultural and was socially organised around the hierarchy of the four varnas, or social classes. This social structure was characterized both by syncretising with the native cultures of northern India,[69] but also eventually by the excluding of some indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure.[70] During this period, many of the previous small tribal units and chiefdoms began to coalesce into Janapadas (monarchical, state-level polities).
            <br><br>
            Janapadas
            Main article: Janapada
            <br><br>
            The Iron Age in the Indian subcontinent from about 1200 BCE to the 6th century BCE is defined by the rise of Janapadas, which are realms, republics and kingdoms—notably the Iron Age Kingdoms of Kuru, Panchala, Kosala, Videha.
            <br><br>
            The Kuru kingdom was the first state-level society of the Vedic period, corresponding to the beginning of the Iron Age in northwestern India, around 1200–800 BCE,[74] as well as with the composition of the Atharvaveda (the first Indian text to mention iron, as śyāma ayas, literally "black metal").[75] The Kuru state organised the Vedic hymns into collections, and developed the orthodox srauta ritual to uphold the social order.[75] Two key figures of the Kuru state were king Parikshit and his successor Janamejaya, transforming this realm into the dominant political, social, and cultural power of northern Iron Age India.[75] When the Kuru kingdom declined, the centre of Vedic culture shifted to their eastern neighbours, the Panchala kingdom.[75] The archaeological PGW (Painted Grey Ware) culture, which flourished in the Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh regions of northern India from about 1100 to 600 BCE,[67] is believed to correspond to the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms.
            <br><br>
            During the Late Vedic Period, the kingdom of Videha emerged as a new centre of Vedic culture, situated even farther to the East (in what is today Nepal and Bihar state in India);[68] reaching its prominence under the king Janaka, whose court provided patronage for Brahmin sages and philosophers such as Yajnavalkya, Aruni, and Gargi Vachaknavi. The later part of this period corresponds with a consolidation of increasingly large states and kingdoms, called mahajanapadas, all across Northern India.
            <br><br>
            Second urbanisation (600–200 BCE)
            <br><br><br><br>
            
            During the time between 800 and 200 BCE the Śramaṇa movement formed, from which originated Jainism and Buddhism. In the same period, the first Upanishads were written. After 500 BCE, the so-called "second urbanisation" started, with new urban settlements arising at the Ganges plain, especially the Central Ganges plain. The foundations for the "second urbanisation" were laid prior to 600 BCE, in the Painted Grey Ware culture of the Ghaggar-Hakra and Upper Ganges Plain; although most PGW sites were small farming villages, "several dozen" PGW sites eventually emerged as relatively large settlements that can be characterized as towns, the largest of which were fortified by ditches or moats and embankments made of piled earth with wooden palisades, albeit smaller and simpler than the elaborately fortified large cities which grew after 600 BCE in the Northern Black Polished Ware culture.
            <br><br>
            The Central Ganges Plain, where Magadha gained prominence, forming the base of the Mauryan Empire, was a distinct cultural area,[80] with new states arising after 500 BCE[81] during the so-called "second urbanisation".[82][note 1] It was influenced by the Vedic culture,[83] but differed markedly from the Kuru-Panchala region.[80] It "was the area of the earliest known cultivation of rice in South Asia and by 1800 BCE was the location of an advanced Neolithic population associated with the sites of Chirand and Chechar".[84] In this region, the Śramaṇic movements flourished, and Jainism and Buddhism originated.

            Gautama Buddha's cremation stupa, Kushinagar (Kushinara).
            <br><br>
            Around 800 BCE to 400 BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads.[4][85][86] Upanishads form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Vedas).[87]  </p>

         <h2 class="blog-post-title">Sanskrit epics</h2>
         <p class="blog-post-meta">December 14, 2013 by <a href="#">Chris</a></p>

          <p>
            The Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata were composed during this period.[92] 
            The Mahabharata remains, today, the longest single poem in the world.[93]
             Historians formerly postulated an "epic age" as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognize that the texts (which are both familiar with each other) went through multiple stages of development over centuries. For instance, the Mahabharata may have been based on a small-scale conflict (possibly about 1000 BCE) which was eventually "transformed into a gigantic epic war by bards and poets".
              There is no conclusive proof from archaeology as to whether the specific events of the Mahabharata have any historical basis.[94] 
              The existing texts of these epics are believed to belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400 BCE and 400 CE.</div>
